# **File Sharing & Payment System Guide**
Chiral Network implements a BitTorrent-like file sharing model with instant seeding and DHT-based discovery.
## **Purpose**
- Facilitate peer-to-peer file sharing incentivized by **Chiral token** exchange.
- Automatically price files using a **global Chiral-to-MB value** or a **hash-power-based dynamic rate**.
- Provide a consistent protocol for **upload, download, and micropayment flows**.
- Ensure seamless integration between:
  - **Frontend**: pricing display, validation, and payment UX,
  - **Backend**: payment services, wallet handling, and transaction logging,
  - **Network layers**: DHT discovery, seeding, and transport protocols.
- Maintain modular separation between **data transmission** and **payment verification**.

---

## **Overview**
- The Chiral Network implements a **BitTorrent-like file sharing model** with DHT-based peer discovery and instant seeding.
- Each uploaded file has an **associated price**, automatically computed using a **global Chiral-to-MB exchange rate**.
- The default conversion is **1 MB = 0.001 Chiral**.
- No manual price entry is required per upload — prices derive automatically from:
  - The **current global Chiral value**, or
  - A **dynamic rate** calculated from **network hash power**, reflecting mining difficulty.
- Files shared on Chiral Network are:
    - Instantly available when added (no upload process)
    - Identified by cryptographic hashes (SHA-256)
    - Discoverable through the DHT network
    - Optionally encrypted with AES-256-GCM
    - Versioned for update tracking

### Basic File Sharing

1. **Navigate to Upload Page** (Shared Files)
2. **Add Files** using one of these methods:
   - Click "Add Files" button
   - Drag & drop files onto the card
   - Drag files anywhere on the page
3. **Files are processed immediately**:
   - Content hash generated (SHA-256)
   - Metadata published to DHT
   - File immediately available for download by peers

### File Encryption

Files can be encrypted before sharing:

1. **Enable encryption** in file upload dialog
2. **Share the file hash** with authorized users
3. **Share the encryption key** securely (out-of-band)

**Encryption Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- Key fingerprinting for verification
- Recipient public key support
- Manifest-based chunk tracking
- Encrypted chunk transfers via WebRTC

### File Versioning

Chiral Network supports file versioning:

1. **Upload a file** normally
2. **Upload updated version** with same base name
3. **System tracks versions** automatically
4. **Users can choose** which version to download

## Downloading Files

### Basic Download

1. **Navigate to Download Page**
2. **Enter file hash** received from peer
3. **Click "Search & Download"**
4. **System will**:
   - Query DHT for file metadata
   - Discover seeders
   - Display peer selection modal
5. **Select peers** to download from
6. **Monitor progress** in download queue

### Multi-Source Downloads

Chiral Network supports downloading from multiple peers simultaneously:

- **Parallel chunk downloads** from different peers
- **Intelligent peer selection** based on reputation
- **Bandwidth aggregation** for faster transfers
- **Automatic failover** if peers disconnect
- **Chunk verification** using merkle tree

### Download Queue Management

**Priority Levels**:
- High: Download immediately
- Normal: Queue normally
- Low: Download when bandwidth available

**Queue Controls**:
- Pause/Resume individual downloads
- Cancel downloads
- Reorder queue
- Set concurrent download limit (1-10)

## File Discovery

### Hash-Based Discovery

Files are discovered using their content hash:

1. **Obtain file hash** from peer (out-of-band)
2. **Search using hash** in Download page
3. **DHT returns**:
   - File metadata (name, size, type, price)
   - List of seeders
   - Encryption status
   - Version information

### Search History

The application maintains search history:
- **Recent searches** saved locally
- **Quick re-download** from history
- **Seeder count** updated in real-time
- **Filter by status** (available, unavailable)

## **System Overview Diagram**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Downloader
    participant DHT
    participant B as Seeder
    participant ETH 

    A->>DHT: Query file hash (metadata request)
    DHT-->>A: Return seeders + price info
    A->>B: Initiate file handshake
    A->>ETH: Verify wallet balance
    ETH-->>A: Balance confirmation
    A->>B: Begin download

    loop Pay-per-MB transfer
        A->>ETH: Send microtransaction
        ETH-->>B: Credit Chiral tokens
        B-->>A: Serve next MB segment
    end

    A-->>DHT: Log download transaction
    B-->>DHT: Log payment receipt
```

- Price and uploader address fields are automatically populated on upload. The backend references the global pricing configuration to maintain consistent pricing across sessions and peers.

### File Metadata:
```typescript
{
  fileHash: string          // SHA-256 content hash
  fileName: string          // Original filename
  fileSize: number          // Size in bytes
  seeders: string[]         // List of seeder peer IDs
  createdAt: number         // Unix timestamp
  merkleRoot?: string       // Merkle tree root for chunks
  mimeType?: string         // File MIME type
  isEncrypted: boolean      // Encryption flag
  encryptionMethod?: string // Encryption algorithm
  keyFingerprint?: string   // Key verification
  version?: number          // File version number
  cids?: string[]           // Content IDs for chunks
  price: number             // price of file in Chiral
}
```
## Seeding Behavior

### Continuous Seeding

Files remain seeded as long as they're in your "Shared Files" list:

- **No upload step**: Files immediately available
- **Real-time seeder count**: Shows how many peers have the file
- **Automatic DHT updates**: Metadata refreshed periodically
- **Bandwidth control**: Configurable upload limits

### Seed Management

**Stop Seeding**:
1. Go to Upload page
2. Find file in list
3. Click Remove/Delete
4. File removed from DHT

**Seed Statistics**:
- Total upload bandwidth contributed
- Number of peers served
- Reputation earned from seeding

## Advanced Features

### Chunk-Based Transfers

Large files are split into chunks:

- **Configurable chunk size** (default 256 KB)
- **Bitswap protocol** for efficient exchange
- **Parallel chunk transfer** from multiple sources
- **Integrity verification** per chunk
- **Resume support** for interrupted transfers

### Bandwidth Scheduling

Control when files are seeded:

1. **Navigate to Settings** → Bandwidth Scheduling
2. **Create schedules** with:
   - Time ranges (HH:MM format)
   - Days of week
   - Upload/download limits
3. **Enable scheduling**
4. **System applies limits** automatically

### File Storage

Files are stored locally:

- **Default location**: `~/ChiralNetwork/Storage`
- **Configurable path**: Change in Settings
- **Storage limits**: Set maximum storage size
- **Auto-cleanup**: Remove old files automatically

## Best Practices

### For Uploaders

1. **Use encryption** for sensitive files
2. **Verify file hashes** before sharing
3. **Share complete files** (no partial uploads)
4. **Keep seeding** to ensure availability
5. **Monitor bandwidth** usage

### For Downloaders

1. **Verify file hashes** with sender
2. **Check seeder count** before downloading
3. **Select multiple sources** for faster downloads
4. **Verify encryption** status
5. **Scan files** before opening

### Privacy Considerations

1. **File hashes reveal content**: Use encryption for privacy
2. **Seeding reveals IP**: Use proxy/relay for anonymity
3. **Metadata is public**: DHT metadata visible to all peers
4. **Consider file names**: Avoid revealing information

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Found
- Verify file hash is correct
- Check if seeders are online
- Wait for DHT propagation (~30 seconds)
- Try searching again later

### Slow Downloads
- Select more seeders
- Check your download bandwidth limit
- Verify seeders have good reputation
- Enable multi-source downloads

### Upload Not Working
- Check DHT is connected
- Verify file is not corrupted
- Ensure storage path is writable
- Check firewall settings

# Global Pricing System

Objective: Maintain a single global configuration for determining the Chiral-to-MB conversion, avoiding manual price setting for every file. 

### Mechanisms

1. Static Global Rate (Default)
    - Conversion: 1 MB = 0.001 Chiral.
    - Stored globally in the DHT or config service.
    - Provides stability and simplicity.

2. Dynamic Hash-Power-Based Rate: Adjusts pricing based on the network’s mining difficulty.
```pricePerMB = (baseHashCost / avgHashPower) * normalizationFactor```


# Download Control & Payment Enforcement Protocol
### Mechanism
##### During downloads:
- Node B (seeder) serves file chunks through HTTP/WebRTC.
- The protocol enforces payment checkpoints after specific data amounts are transmitted.

##### Example Control Logic:
- Serve first 10 MB as initial handshake segment.
- If no payment received after 10 MB → stop serving.
- If payment received → continue serving.
- Download resumes with incremental payments:
   - 1 MB --> pay Chiral
   - 2 MB --> pay Chiral
   - 4 MB --> pay Chiral
   - etc

##### Payment Options


| Mode                     | Description                                        | Recommended For                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- 
| **Exponential Scaling**  | Payments grow as trust builds (1→2→4→8 MB).        | Typical use case, balances risk and efficiency. |
| **Full Upfront Payment** | Pay entire file price at once.                     | Trusted seeders or verified peers.              |

##### Payment Flow Protocol
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Downloader
  participant B as Seeder
  participant E as Ethereum

  A->>B: PAYMENT_INIT (fileHash, MB_count)
  B->>E: Create/verify payment channel
  E-->>B: Channel ready
  loop For each MB segment
    A->>E: Send microtransaction
    E-->>B: Credit Chiral balance
    B-->>A: Send MB data
    alt Payment timeout
      B-->>A: Stop serving
    end
  end
  A-->>E: Close payment channel
  E-->>A: Transaction summary
```
#### Ethereum/Chiral Integration:
##### Wallet Capabilities:
Each peer node runs a local Ethereum-compatible wallet supporting:
- getBalance()
- sendPayment(address, amount)
- verifyTransaction(txHash)
- logTransaction(metadata)

##### Transaction Model
Transactions include:
- Recipient address (seeder)
- File hash reference
- Payment amount (in Chiral)
- Metadata (timestamp, MB segment)

#### Security
- Transactions are cryptographically signed with user’s private key.
- DHT stores public receipts only, never private keys.
- Local key storage handled securely within native environment (e.g., Tauri).

#### Gas and Fees
- Each transaction includes a small gas fee.
- Estimated cost = base gas + data fee.
- Option to dynamically add a “gas surcharge” to file price for accurate costing.

### Frontend Integration
#### Features
- Automatic price computation after file upload.
- Price badges display file cost in Chiral.
- Balance check prior to download.
- Payment confirmation modals for user validation.
- Transaction logs shown in account dashboard.
- Live peer-to-peer toasts for payment success/failure notifications.

#### Payment UI Flow
``` mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[User selects file to download] --> B[Fetch metadata & price]
  B --> C[Check user balance]
  C -->|Sufficient| D[Show payment modal]
  C -->|Insufficient| E[Show balance error]
  D --> F[Execute payment]
  F --> G[Start incremental download]
  G --> H[Record transaction in history]
```

### Areas for Improvement & TODOs
- Define rounding rules for price display (e.g., 4 decimal places).
- Add automated tests for global pricing updates.
- Handle empty or zero-byte file uploads gracefully.
- Include uploader/audit logs for all uploads.
- Implement transaction timeouts and retry strategies.
- Add multi-seeder payment splitting support.
- Include gas fee estimation in pricing UI.
- Enable dynamic rate propagation through DHT.
- Build reputation registry for trust-weighted pricing.
- Develop control parameters for HTTP server payment enforcement.


### Summary
##### The Chiral File Sharing & Payment System integrates peer-to-peer file distribution with an adaptive Chiral-based payment mechanism. This system ensures:
- Automated and fair file pricing through global or hash-based valuation.
- Incremental, flexible payment protocols tied to network trust.
- Ethereum-backed settlement for verifiable transactions.
- Scalable architecture for decentralized, incentive-aligned file exchange.
